whenisgood, but the best.

But now... with very basic session-tracking capabilities!

## How do I see what you did?

After adding several events using the Send to Back-End button on the `/create_event` route, change the route to `/history` and you will hopefully see a list of the events you created. Close out and start it up again. Still there I hope! Now try in a new browser. Is it gone?
